    <p>Fresh pasta isn't something to master in one go. It takes time and practice, but it yields dividends. This
        particular recipe is vastly versatile. It can be made into whole grain pasta by swapping in 1 cup sifted whole
        wheat, spelt or farro flour in place of 1 cup all-purpose or 00 flour. Add more egg yolks or water as needed and
        rest the dough for 1 hour. Or try a green pasta: Steam or sauté 6 ounces baby spinach (about 6 cups), squeeze
        dry, and purée; then mix into the eggs before combining with the flour.</p>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>On a large, clean surface, make a mound with the flour and create a deep well in the center.</li>
        <li>Crack the eggs into the well and beat gently with a fork, incorporating flour from the sides gradually.</li>
        <li>Continue mixing until a dough forms, then knead for 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest for at least 30 minutes before rolling out.</li>
    </ol>
